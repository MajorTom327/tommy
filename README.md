# Tommy Extension

Providing simple functionality to VSCode in js/ts projects.

## Features


### Barrelize a folder
Barrelize your folders with a click. This will generate a barrel file for the selected folder and will export all the files inside of it. This will be done recursively for all the subfolders as well.

This is useful for when you want to import a lot of imports from a directory and you don't want to import each file individually.

### Ignore files in a folder
Just a utility to right-click and gitignore a file or folder

## Future Features
- Attach scripts to project and execute them easily
